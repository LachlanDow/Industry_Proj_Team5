Client Meeting notes
Time - 12:20 - 12:40

Happy with the way it looks, likes the scoring, likes the way that you can see past questions

Implement multiplayer aspect. 

Questions about how teams are working

Difficult to work with - asked how we broke team down for front end and backend, used frontend tools, asked about techstack, approves of techstack

Priority to add multiplayer, and already in progrss stories, powerup additions, join public game.
